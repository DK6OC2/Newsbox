A lot of the following code has been taken from https://github.com/oelna/microblog (MIT) Copyright 2023 Arno Richter
Arno already had the approach for his microblog application that I was looking for and consider to be very user-friendly. So I orientated myself on his code and adopted some parts of it. Thank you Arno for your very good work. It has helped and inspired me.
